	description: "Her first job was at a small tech startup as a #productmanager. The startup was acquired by a giant tech-related firm (everyone knows this company), which led to her continuing her #PM job there. She then went beyond Japan and successfully started another tech company's Trust and Safety office overseas. She is currently a PM in a tech startup back in Tokyo. 
I reached out to her because I wanted to know more about #PM careers."
